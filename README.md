# 100-Days-of-Coding
The "100-days-of-code" repo is a record of my journey to improve my coding skills over 100 days. It's got daily logs of my progress, including coding challenges, projects, and my reflections on what I learned. I created this repo to inspire and encourage other developers who want to go on a similar learning journey.
